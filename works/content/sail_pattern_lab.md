Building on past work with active haptic feedback systems that communicate performance data during athletic training, our team is developing a web application to evaluate how haptic patterns affect brain waves.

## Research Approach

We're exploring technology-enabled test protocols to measure, categorize and qualify different haptic patterns. The goal is to understand how different tactile feedback patterns affect cognitive performance and brain activity.

## Key Findings

Initial studies show promising results in using haptic patterns to enhance focus and reduce cognitive load during complex tasks.
